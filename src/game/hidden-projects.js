/**
 * Repos you have taken off the map.
 *
 * Colony-only, and that is the whole point: hiding writes nothing to any harness and archives
 * nothing. The threads stay exactly where they are and keep working; the map just stops drawing
 * that repo until you show it again. It is for the checkout you have forty dead threads in and
 * do not want owning a third of your ground.
 *
 * Keyed on the project *name*, which is what plots are keyed on too. That has a consequence
 * worth knowing: a second checkout of the same repo appearing renames `foo` to `1/foo` (see
 * `disambiguateProjects` in server/scan.mjs) and the hide quietly stops matching. Keying on the
 * path instead would fix it and break the moment somebody moves a folder, and the layout has the
 * same trade — so both are wrong in the same direction, which is at least predictable.
