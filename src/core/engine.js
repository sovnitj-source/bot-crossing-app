/**
 * Renderer, post chain, and the frame loop.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing for performance:
 *
 * 1. **The post chain is built lazily and torn down when off.** With bloom disabled the
 *    composer is not merely skipped — it is disposed, so its float render targets stop
 *    costing memory and bandwidth. Turning HDR off on a weak machine has to actually
 *    give the memory back, not just stop drawing.
 * 2. **Render scale is separate from device pixel ratio.** `setPixelRatio` alone cannot go
 *    below 1 usefully on a retina panel, so the drawing buffer is sized directly. That is
 *    the single biggest lever there is, and it is what the auto-quality governor pulls.
 *
 *    The setting is a fraction of *the display's own resolution*, not of CSS pixels: 100%
 *    on a retina panel is 2 buffer pixels per CSS pixel. Reading it as CSS pixels is what
 *    the earlier version did, and it quietly rendered every retina machine at half
 *    resolution — text on the name plates and the badge glyphs magnify hardest, so they
 *    are where a soft buffer shows up first.
